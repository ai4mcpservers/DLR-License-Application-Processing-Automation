# DLR-License-Application-Processing-Automation
This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques to solve a critical pain point for the Dept. of Licensing and Regulation: automating the initial review and categorization of license applications. Currently, DLR staff manually review thousands of applications monthly, leading to processing delays and inconsistent evaluations.
