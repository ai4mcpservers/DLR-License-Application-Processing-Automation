1. Consistency Testing Protocol
Multi-Run Consistency

Run identical inputs 5+ times
Measure variance in key outputs
Target: <5% variance for numerical scores
Target: 100% consistency for categorical decisions

Edge Case Robustness
pythonEDGE_CASES = [
    "missing_critical_data",
    "conflicting_information", 
    "boundary_condition_values",
    "unusual_but_valid_scenarios",
    "malformed_input_data"
]
2. Performance Benchmarking
Speed Metrics

Target: <30 seconds per application
Batch processing: 50+ applications simultaneously
Peak load handling: 500+ applications/hour

Accuracy Validation
pythonACCURACY_METRICS = {
    "completeness_detection": ">95% accuracy",
    "risk_classification": ">90% accuracy", 
    "regulatory_compliance": "100% accuracy",
    "false_positive_rate": "<5%",
    "false_negative_rate": "<2%"
}

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Data: 3,000 tokens (37.5%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Examples/Few-shot: 1,000 tokens (12.5%)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output Buffer: 500 tokens (6.25%)
Dynamic Context Prioritization
pythondef prioritize_context(application_data):
    priority_order = [
        "safety_critical_info",      # Always include
        "regulatory_requirements",   # Always include  
        "risk_indicators",          # High priority
        "completeness_data",        # High priority
        "background_details",       # Medium priority
        "supplementary_info"        # Low priority - truncate if needed
    ]
    return build_context_within_limits(priority_order)
2. Temperature and Parameter Optimization
Task-Specific Temperature Settings
pythonTEMPERATURE_SETTINGS = {
    "completeness_check": 0.1,    # High consistency required
    "risk_assessment": 0.2,       # Slight variation acceptable
    "final_recommendation": 0.1,   # Must be consistent
    "citizen_communication": 0.3   # Can be more natural/varied
}
3. Chain-of-Thought Integration
Structured Reasoning Process
pythonREASONING_FRAMEWORK = """
STEP 1: INITIAL ASSESSMENT
- What type of application is this?
- What are the key requirements?
- Are there any immediate red flags?

STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION  
- Document completeness: {score}/100
- Risk factors identified: {list}
- Regulatory compliance: {status}

STEP 3: DECISION SYNTHESIS
- Primary recommendation: {decision}
- Supporting evidence: {evidence}
- Confidence level: {percentage}

STEP 4: QUALITY CHECK
- Does this decision protect public safety? {yes/no}
- Is this fair to the applicant? {yes/no}  
- Would I defend this decision to my supervisor? {yes/no}
